# 🏡 California Housing Price Prediction using Decision Tree Regression

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Internship (Task 3)**. The objective is to build a machine learning regression model to predict California housing prices while implementing **model validation**, **overfitting control**, and **hyperparameter tuning** techniques.

The project follows a complete machine learning workflow, including data exploration, visualization, model training, evaluation, cross-validation, and optimization using GridSearchCV.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize housing data using different plots
- Build a Decision Tree Regression model
- Detect and reduce overfitting
- Apply Cross Validation
- Optimize the model using GridSearchCV
- Compare model performance before and after tuning
- Evaluate using RMSE, MAE, and R² Score

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the **California Housing Dataset** available in the **Scikit-learn** library.

The dataset contains information about housing districts in California with features such as:

- Median Income
- House Age
- Average Rooms
- Average Bedrooms
- Population
- Average Occupancy
- Latitude
- Longitude

**Target Variable:**
- Median House Value (`MedHouseVal`)
